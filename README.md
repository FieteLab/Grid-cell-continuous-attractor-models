# Grid cell continuous attractor models

Simulation code for grid cell activity based on continuous attractor dynamics in neural networks, with periodic or aperiodic boundary conditions. The code can be run with random or recorded trajectory data from rats (included in download). View the associated ReadMe files for more information.
